TYPO3 Exception 1349868540
==========================

If you encountered this exception, please help others by providing

<docs-contribute-github-method>`!

No composer manifest file found at "/..../www/typo3conf/ext/myextension//composer.json".
========================================================================================

I did some modification to the (running) extension to add one field and
to delete 5 fields. Now the extension manager and the language-module
came up with this error. The extension was initial build with
extension-builder and there never was a file "composer.json". The
install-Tool says: "All local extensions can be loaded!" which is not
correct as the plugin is not available any more.

Solution
--------

the folders (and files?) of the extension needs to be accessible for PHP
(I copied the files from remote via ssh and changed the owner and the
access-rights while saving)
