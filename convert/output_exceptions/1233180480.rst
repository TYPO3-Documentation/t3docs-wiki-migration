error message
=============

#. 1233180480: The method "yourMethod" is not supported by the
   repository

Analysis
========

-  check if the method **yourMethod** is not defined in the repository,
   also with respect to spelling (lowercase and upercase).
-  check the visibility of the method (public, protected, private)

Solution
========

-  define the method **yourMethod** or correct the spelling.
-  change the visibility of the method to public if it's called from a
   controller or somewhere else outside the repository itself. If the
   method is called from a sub-repository-class the visibility can be
   either public too or protected but not private.
