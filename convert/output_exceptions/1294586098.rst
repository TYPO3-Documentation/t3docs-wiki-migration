| TYPO3 backend error: **Lock file could not be created**
| Typo3 back-end show this error probably because (deprecation-) log
  file in /typo3conf/ is getting over 30 MB.
| To solve this error, delete the 'deprecation.log' -file in /typo3conf/
  and change settings:
| For TYPO3 v4.x
| In '/typo3conf/localconf.php' add this lineÂ :
| $ TYPO3_CONF_VARS ['SYS'] ['enableDeprecationLog'] = '0 ';
| For TYPO3 v6.x
| In '/typo3conf/localconfiguration.php' add this line between: 'SYS' =>
  array( ),
| 'enableDeprecationLog' => '0',
