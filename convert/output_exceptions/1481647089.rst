   #1481647089: Invalid flex form data structure on field name "pi_flexform" with element "foo" in section container "content": Nesting select and group elements in flex form sections is not allowed with MM relations. 

Happens on TYPO3 v8 when using a multiRelation field inside a section
container

This `also happens with flux
8 <https://github.com/FluidTYPO3/flux/issues/1446>`__ when using a
<flux:field.relation> tag. This has `been fixed in flux
9.0.0 <https://github.com/FluidTYPO3/flux/issues/1446>`__.
