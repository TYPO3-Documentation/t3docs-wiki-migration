**RealURL is not able to find the root page id for the given domain**

RealURL searches in the sys_domain table for a domain with matches the
current host. It would then detect the PID of the domain record and
hence get the rootpage of the domain.

If this exception is thrown, than

-  either no domain record exists for the current domain (solution: add
   domain record)
-  or a proxy modifies the host of the request and realurl cant find it
   (solution: check what realurl uses to match a domain, check for
   proxies, maybe add a domainrecord)
-  or RealURL cant handle ports in the domain (eg: localhost:8023 -
   currently no other solution than switching to a host without ports or
   overwrite the ConfigurationReader class)
