===========

::

   The template files "/home/.....t3bootstrap/Resources/Private/Layouts/Content", "/home/....t3bootstrap/Resources/Private/Layouts/Content.html" could not be loaded.

Reason
------

Happend by using Flux 7.0.0

Solution
^^^^^^^^

None until now

Eventually you haven't include fluidcontent_bootstrap in your template.
Just include it.
