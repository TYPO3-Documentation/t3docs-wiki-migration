I received this error when using the new style configuration of filefill
``$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTCONF']['filefill']['storages'][1] = [``

````

::

      'placeholder' => true,
      [
          'identifier' => 'domain',
          'configuration' => 'https://www.example.de/' [not available anymore],
      ],
      [
          'identifier' => 'placeholder',
      ]

````

``];`` with a too old version of filefill (<3)

upgrading filefill to 3.2.1 did the trick for me.
