After updating the current list of available plugins from the TYPO3
Extension Repository I received the above mentioned exception, namely:
"Version number in composer manifest of package "vhs" is missing or
invalid".

This happens in TYPO3 6.2 whenever an extension has a dependency on
another extension which contains a file ``composer.json`` without any
version number (which is actually the best practice).

Simple solution for the time being since composer is not properly
supported in TYPO3 6.2 is to delete the corresponding file
``composer.json`` or to explicitly set a version number.
