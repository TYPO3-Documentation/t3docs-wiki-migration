   #1440685208: Broken data structure on field name pi_flexform. section without type or vice versa is not allowed

Happens when using
`<flux:form.container> <https://fluidtypo3.org/viewhelpers/flux/master/Form/ContainerViewHelper.html>`__
[not available anymore] in a fluid content element.

In our case it was due to <type>no_map</type> which we commented out.
Then I worked.

    Broken data structure on field name tx_templavoila_flex. section without type or vice versa is not allowed

Type nodes need to ne inside of »tx_templavoila«. Only exception if the
type is of »array«, butthen it needs a »<section>1</section>« node in
the same level.
