**ISSUE**

This usually occurs with a fresh installation of TYPO3 6.2.4, right
after the first login to the backend of the newly installed system, but
can also occur with an existing installation. It often happens when
downloading the preconfigured distributions in the Extension Manager.

**POSSIBLE SOLUTION**

php.ini (or vhost configuration)

::

   allow_url_fopen = On
   max_execution_time = 300
