Happened for me when I wanted to access backend flexform of one of my
own extensions after upgrading to TYPO3 8.7 LTS.

Fix: If there's only one display condition, remove all the unnecessary
stuff from Configuration/FlexForms/FlexformPlugin.xml (or whatever your
flexform file is named).

           <numIndex>FIELD:switchableControllerActions:!=:Event->list</numIndex>

        </AND>

     </displayCond>
