I realized this message with a HTTP404 when my eID script was registered
but not found. (T3v9.5, eID PSR style)

How did I see it was registered?

Backend Configuration display:
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['eID_include']['myext'] was set to
"myext = Company\Myext\Core\EID::processRequest"

The call to the domain showed a nice page; adding ?eID=myext brought up
the 404.

Solution: Not Yet foundÂ :-(
