The error "The specified compression of type "integer" but a boolean is
expected. When your cache configuration is invalid. Check
typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php and
typo3conf/AdditionalConfiguration.php looking for sth like:

::

      'pages' => [
          'backend' => 'TYPO3\\CMS\\Core\\Cache\\Backend\\RedisBackend',
          'options' => [
              'compression' => 1,
          ],
      ],

and change it to

::

      'pages' => [
          'backend' => 'TYPO3\\CMS\\Core\\Cache\\Backend\\RedisBackend',
          'options' => [
              'compression' => true,
          ],
      ],
