TYPO3 Exception 1438594406
==========================

.. note::
   If you encountered this exception, please help others by providing
   information about how you got this error. Especially if you have a solution,
   please add it to this page by following the :ref:`"Edit on GitHub" workflow
   <docs-contribute-github-method>`!

On possible cause for this is the use of old ext_tables/TCA
configuration. Please see
https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-core/master/en-us/Changelog/7.6/Index.html
for the changes in TYPO3. Also, the TCA file must return the array, not
only declare it, as would work before.
