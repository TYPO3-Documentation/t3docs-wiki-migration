Happened after updating from TYPO3 6.0 to TYPO3 6.2.2. The extension
RealURL: Clear cache [realurl_clearcache] threw the error

Fatal error: require_once(): Failed opening required
'/public_html/typo3/interfaces/interface.backend_cacheActionsHook.php'
in
/public_html/typo3conf/ext/realurl_clearcache/class.tx_realurlclearcache_cachemenu.php
on line 35

So I had to remove

::

      'realurl_clearcache' => 
      array (
        'state' => 'active',
        'packagePath' => 'typo3conf/ext/realurl_clearcache/',
        'classesPath' => 'Classes/',
      ),

from typo3conf/PackageStates.php

Then this error occurred:

Oops, an error occurred!

$hookObject must implement interface
TYPO3\CMS\Backend\Toolbar\ClearCacheActionsHookInterface

| 
| **Solution:**

Clear the cache in the Install tool:

Important actions

Clear all cache
