**Case 1:**

This happened when i added a filemount 4:GoedZorgen which got the number
8: (4: = fileadmin/user_uploadÂ ; 8: = fileadmin/user_upload/GoedZorgen)

and then added a media file to a content element using this filemount 8:

and then deleted the filemount number 8:

**Case 2:**

A file storage with an unreachable base path has been tried to access.
This might happen after importing a database.

Check the filemount entries with the list module.

Are the folder paths in the field "base path" correct?
