Deleting all files in "typo3temp/Cache" through console, did the job for
me.

``rm -rf typo3temp/Cache/*``

For me it was to delete all files in "typo3temp/autoload" through
console.

``rm -rf typo3temp/autoload/*``

The way registering the Hook has changed in ext_localconf.php:

.. container::

   ::

      // Prior Typo3 8
      //$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SC_OPTIONS']['cms/layout/class.tx_cms_layout.php']['tt_content_drawItem'][] = 'EXT:extensionkey/Classes/Hooks/PageLayoutViewDrawItemHook.php:&Vendor\\Extensionkey\\Hooks\\PageLayoutViewDrawItemHook';

.. container::

   ::

      // Typo3 8:
      $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SC_OPTIONS']['cms/layout/class.tx_cms_layout.php']['tt_content_drawItem'][] = 'Vendor\\Extensionkey\\Hooks\\PageLayoutViewDrawItemHook';
