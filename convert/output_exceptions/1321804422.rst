TYPO3 Exception 1321804422
==========================

.. note::
If you encountered this exception, please help others by providing
information about how you got this error. Especially if you have a solution,
please add it to this page by following the :ref:`"Edit on GitHub" workflow
<docs-contribute-github-method>`!

I encounter this error as soon as there is a htaccess that requires
login data, like this:

AuthUserFile /www/path/to/folder/.htpasswd AuthGroupFile /dev/null
AuthName 'Bitte Zugangsdaten eingeben' AuthType Basic require valid-user

As soon as the login data was entered (correctly), this error appears:
Could not open log file "/www/path/to/folder/typo3temp/logs/typo3.log"

At the moment I have no solution - sorry...

--------------

Deleting the file helps in my case
