**Solution 1:**

This exception might occur in EXT:news since version 3.1.0.

To solve it, please add "list.paginate.itemsPerPage" to the TS setting
*overrideFlexformSettingsIfEmpty*.

The final code might look like this

plugin.tx_news.settings.overrideFlexformSettingsIfEmpty =
cropMaxCharacters,dateField,timeRestriction,orderBy,orderDirection,backPid,listPid,startingpoint,recursive,list.paginate.itemsPerPage

| **Solution 2:**

Include the EXT:news static into your root-template (or
extension-template)
