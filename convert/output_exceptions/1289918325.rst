#1289918325: Module 'my_module' is not configured. (More information)
=====================================================================

This message appears when trying to load a module from BE context
sensitive menu. The module was configured in Route.php and loaded via
BackendControllerHook.

This problem appears when changing the module name and clearing cache
even with install tool does nothing.

The solution was to remove typo3temp folder.

Other case
----------

The Exception appeared as well during upgrade procedure 7.6 to 8.7, when
trying to access the InstallTool via BackEnd. Use
domain.tld/typo/install/ instead, no folder removing necessary.
