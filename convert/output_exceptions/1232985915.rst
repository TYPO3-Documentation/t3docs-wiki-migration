Exception
=========

::

      [ TYPO3\CMS\Core\Cache\Exception ]
      #1232985915: The APCu backend cannot be used because apcu is disabled on CLI.
      thrown in file typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Cache/Backend/ApcuBackend.php
      in line 84

This error occurs if TYPO3 is execute in command line context. The
reason is, that ``typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php`` uses
``TYPO3\\CMS\\Core\\Cache\\Backend\\ApcuBackend`` as caching backend,
which works fine if called using an HTTP-context (e.g. via Apache or
nginx) but does not if invoked via CLI (command line interface).

Adjust PHP CLI configuration to fix this behavior
=================================================

-  modify configuration file ``/etc/php/7.1/cli/conf.d/20-apcu.ini`` (as
   an exaxmple on Ubuntu 17.10)
-  add new setting ``apc.enable_cli=on``
