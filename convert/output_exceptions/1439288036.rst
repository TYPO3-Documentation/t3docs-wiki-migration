"An item in field XXXXX of table YYYYY is not an array as expected"

This happens in TYPO3 7.6 if there is a incompatible 'items' TCA
definition in the according field like

.. container::

   `PHP
   Script <https://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/Help:Contents#Syntax-Highlighting_for_PHP-Code>`__
   [deprecated wiki link]

.. container::

   ::

      'items' => [
          '0' => '-'
      ]

or

.. container::

   `PHP
   Script <https://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/Help:Contents#Syntax-Highlighting_for_PHP-Code>`__
   [deprecated wiki link]

.. container::

   ::

      'items' => ['-']

This has to be replaced with a correct item definition like

.. container::

   `PHP
   Script <https://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/Help:Contents#Syntax-Highlighting_for_PHP-Code>`__
   [deprecated wiki link]

.. container::

   ::

      'items' => [
          ['-', 0]
      ]
