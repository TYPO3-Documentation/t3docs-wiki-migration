   #1270853878: TYPO3 Fatal Error: Extension key "adodb" is NOT loaded!

Please check, whether you have downloaded and installed the called
extension (in this case "adodb") in the backends extension manager.

| 
| Another situation where this error is thrown is when the extension
  "mageconnect" is installed.

After deleting the whole content of the folder "/typo3temp/Cache" the
installation was running again (the deleted files are written new).

In general the error perhaps could be thrown too if one dependency is
not met (means: one required extension is missing), but this was not
given here.

If the extension is only for BE and depends on another extension such as
scheduler, one has to set in the ext_localconf.php of that extension the
variable doNotLoadInFE to 1.
