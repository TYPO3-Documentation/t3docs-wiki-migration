Unknown column 'tx_myext_domain_model_myfield.' in 'order clause'
=================================================================

There's no 'foreign_sorting' set in TCA. For me it happened with an
Inline type.

Table 'my_db.tx_myext_domain_model_myfield' doesn't exist
=========================================================

When you have mapped a relation to an external model in your extension,
but forgot to define the mapping in Typoscript

Table 'my_db.tx_myext_persistence_objectstorage' doesn't exist
