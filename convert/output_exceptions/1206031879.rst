TYPO3 Exception 1206031879
==========================

.. note::
If you encountered this exception, please help others by providing
information about how you got this error. Especially if you have a solution,
please add it to this page by following the :ref:`"Edit on GitHub" workflow
<docs-contribute-github-method>`!

It is explicit enough to understand that the TYPE can't be found,
knowing you have three choices, all set in
\\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Configuration\ConfigurationManagerInterface :

-  'Framework', which is set by CONFIGURATION_TYPE_FRAMEWORK
-  'Settings', which is set by CONFIGURATION_TYPE_SETTINGS
-  'FullTypoScript', which is set by CONFIGURATION_TYPE_FULL_TYPOSCRIPT

First, be sure you use only one of these three possibilities.

Then be sure you call the constant without quotes :

::

   \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Configuration\ConfigurationManagerInterface::CONFIGURATION_TYPE_SETTINGS

And not

::

   '\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Configuration\ConfigurationManagerInterface::CONFIGURATION_TYPE_SETTINGS'
