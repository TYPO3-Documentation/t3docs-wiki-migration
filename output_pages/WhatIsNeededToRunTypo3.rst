TYPO3 is a content management system programmed in PHP, but it is not an
application in the usual sense (Windows or Linux). In other words: TYPO3
is installed on a webserver alongside PHP, and you work with it through
a web browser - like Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox - you "run"
TYPO3 on the server.

To run TYPO3 successfully there are some requirements for both server
and client (user) that must be met.
