Ideas, refhistory, howtolinktothis
==================================

**For links to this page:** If you like, you can set external links to
headers **level 1**, because they will not change. Not deeper, plese.

*refhistory: 0.4 Tips for Extension-Developers and simpler doc-structure
, 0.3 NOT compatible licences, 0.2 compatible licences with GPL, 0.1
Planning/Brainstorming/Concept, 0.0 The reason why this doc was created
was a discussion in the ECT-mailing-list about different ajax-libs and
what lib(s) can be included into TYPO3.*

| 
| **Ideas** for version 1.1 after review

-  include content-licences like creative commons

| 
| **how to use this**

The licenses are a very important topic of the ECT and of the core-team,
too. This is the reason this document should belong to the category
"share".

Needed search-keywords for the wiki-search: *license, licence, licenses,
compatible, GPL, LGPL, MIT, X11, BSD , Apache, Apache2.0, Common Public
License, MPL, Mozilla Public License, Sun Public License* . Some people
name it "licence" (see google) so a forward for that alias-name would be
a good thing.

============================
Compatible licences with GPL
============================

We have to care about the right `license </Category:License>`__
[deprecated wiki link]. You can use components with the following
licenses in the `TER TYPO3
Repository </Glossary#TYPO3_extension_repository_.28TER.29>`__
[deprecated wiki link] **without any problems in law**.

**Tips for Extension-Developers:**

-  The original license-header of the component-file(s) you want to
   include must stay in the head. By the way: This is not a
   "relicensing", it's just a use of the component.
-  **QUESTION->** what shall an extension-writer do, if it is needed to
   change the code a little bit, so that it better fits into TYPO3?

For manuals
===========

See this:

.. container::

   notice - Open Content License

   .. container::

      This document is published under the `Open Content
      License <http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/>`__
      The content is related to TYPO3 - a GNU/GPL CMS/Framework
      available from `typo3.org <http://typo3.org>`__

LGPL
====

This is compatible with GPL. Example:
`xajax <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/xajax/>`__, which is base
for several extensions.

If you are running a project what needs to be 100% GPL, than you can use
paragraph 3 of the license to switch it to GPL. That's a special
opportunity of this license.

MIT (real name is X11)
======================

This is compatible with GPL. The license is not used in the moment in
TER.

BSD
===

This is compatible with GPL. The license is used for example by
`scriptaculous <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/scriptaculous/>`__
and `jquery <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/jquery/>`__ in the
TER.

==========================================================
in use somewhere else but NOT compatible licences with GPL
==========================================================

**Tips for Extension-Developers:**

-  Write an E-Mail to the author of the component you like to include,
   because you may get a copy with a GPL-compatible license!

Apache, Apache2.0, Common Public License 1.0, MPL Mozilla Public License, Sun Public License
============================================================================================

For **details** of these licences and more see the GNU-list (see top on
page) . The reason we list the names of some is, that the wiki-search
now can find this page.
