The house features 25 "homes", most of them in a holiday-flat layout
featuring 2 or 3 bedrooms.

Food
----

The flats have kitchens - no breakfast included, no hotel dinner in the
evening! However, we have organized dinners by night with everyone
(except on night skiing night), and on some days those dinners are even
free for you (thanks to our kind sponsors!) **Please be social and join
the group for dinner - do not cook or go out by yourself more than
once.**

**Breakfast is not centrally organized** - everyone should be able to
take care of themselves. There are a MiniM and a Spar in walking
distance, and bread/rolls delivery is available in the morning.

Please note that while the kitchens have everything from oven to dish
washer, there are only Nespresso machines, so you may want to bring
capsules - or an alternative coffee maker.

Ski Ticket Infos & Inclusives
=============================

-  Ski lifts in the valley of Ötztal, including glacier of Sölden

Daily overview, Sessions & Session Requests
===========================================

Interacting with others, including talking about TYPO3 (and related
topics), is a huge part of this event. Some of this can happen in
scheduled "talks" (or discussions, Q&As, coding sessions, ...), a lot of
it more informally, of course. Also, we always have some fun events that
need scheduling :)

So for everything with a fixed date & time, here's the overview:
