General information
===================

This wiki page is an amendment to the `section "Upgrade" in the
Installation and Upgrade
Guide <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/InstallationGuide/Upgrade/>`__.
The guide contains the general upgrade information, which you should
follow. This wiki page holds additions to this information for the
upgrade to a specific version.

Read the Release notes
======================

You should not only go through the upgrade notes, which this page has
for *the* version, to which you are updating, but also the notes for any
*intermediate versions*, as these might also contain instructions you
should follow.

You should also read the Release Notes of the main versions you go
through when updating (e.g. 6.2.0 and 7.6.0). These documents contain a
section called "Upgrading", which you should follow. See list of all see
https://get.typo3.org.
