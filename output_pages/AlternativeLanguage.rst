Alternative Language

  (`edit <https://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/index.php?title=Alternative_Language&action=edit&section=0>`__
  [deprecated wiki link])
| If you would like to write documentation in other language than
  English, start here. But please consider writing in english first -
  most people will benefit from that!

Translation guideline
=====================

-  English is the primary language for TYPO3 documentation, so all new
   documents should be written in English!
-  If an English document already exists, *then* it is okay to translate
   the document into another language.
-  We should only translate individual pages. Don´t waste time
   translating "structural" pages such as section pages or the
   {Head-Xxxx} templates.

*Please think twice before starting a translation. Wiki pages are
usually updated more frequently than other forms of documentation (OOo,
PDF, etc.). For this reason translations can become quickly outdated.*

How to start translating a page
===============================

Just create a new page with the same name prefixed by the language code.

**Example:**

::

   English        French            German            Japanese
   Main_Page  --> Fr:Main_Page  --> De:Main_Page  --> Ja:Main_Page

   You see the pagenames are all english ;-)

Then look if an english version of your topic exists.
