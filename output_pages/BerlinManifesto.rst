Berlin Manifesto
================

In October 2008, the TYPO3 Core team gathered for development meetings
in Berlin. The primary focus of these meetings was the roadmap for
TYPO3, both the current TYPO3 v4 and the upcoming TYPO3 v5. In addition
to the details of the roadmap [outdated link], the team also clarified
the future of v4 and v5 for agencies and developers using TYPO3.

-  TYPO3 v4 continues to be actively developed and future releases will
   see its features converge with those in TYPO3 v5.
-  TYPO3 v5 will be the successor to TYPO3 v4, but v4 development will
   continue after the the release of v5.
-  Migration of content from TYPO3 v4 to TYPO3 v5 will be easily
   possible.
-  TYPO3 v5 will introduce many new concepts and ideas. Learning never
   stops but resources will be available to ensure a smooth transition.
