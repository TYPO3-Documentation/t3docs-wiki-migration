**Instant communication platform (Slack)**

The TYPO3 CMS team is using a tool called Slack to openly communicate
with each other and with the public. "Slack" replaces our old "Skype
meetings" in a more open, inviting and modern environment. The Slack
tool is also used by plenty of other teams around the TYPO3 ecosphere so
it is easier to interconnect teams.

Mini howtos
===========

Create a channel
----------------

.. container::

   notice - Draft

   .. container::

      Change the **{{draft}}** marker to **{{review}}** when you need a
      reviewer for text and TypoScript. info [outdated wiki link]

In Slack, everyone can create channels. Please follow these simple rules
to make it helpful for everyone:

-  use naming conventions (and your common sense)
-  add a "channel purpose"
-  optional: Additionally, add a title (you can see it in the top)
-  get a channel closed if it is no longer required

Set a channel purpose
---------------------

.. container::

   notice - Draft

   .. container::

      Change the **{{draft}}** marker to **{{review}}** when you need a
      reviewer for text and TypoScript. info [outdated wiki link]

**How to add a purpose:**

Click on the "i" on the top and "Set a channel purpose" in the right
under "Channel Details"

**Why is it good to add a purpose?**

Not all channel names are self-explanatory, especially when there are
similar names. The purpose is listed in the channel selector and if
someone clicks on "i" in the top.

How to get a channel closed
---------------------------

Notify an admin (with @username).

See `list of
admins <https://typo3.slack.com/account/workspace-settings#admins>`__.

Example:

*"@someadmin Please close this channel because ..."*

Naming conventions for channels
===============================

.. container::

   notice - Draft

   .. container::

      Change the **{{draft}}** marker to **{{review}}** when you need a
      reviewer for text and TypoScript. info [outdated wiki link]

Not all channels conform to these naming conventions and the naming are
conventions are still in draft. Please help to finalize this section!

general tips:

-  Use names from more general to more specific, separated by dash
   ('-'). Example: *#generalcategory-specificcategory*. This way if
   someone is in several similar channels, they will be sorted in a way
   that is helpful for them.
-  Channels about a general topic often begin with #cig (e.g.
   **#cig-performance**)
-  Use well-known terms for things that are already being used. Example:
   **#t3cs** is used for TYPO3 camp Stuttgart. That is already being
   used as hashtag. **#t3ch-hamburg** adds additional clarification and
   disambiguation.

specific conventions:

-  Channels for specific extensions: *#ext-<extkey>*, example:
   **#ext-news**
-  Channels for user groups: *#t3ug<usergroupname>''*, example:
   **#t3ughof** (user group Hof), **#t3ugrn** (user group Rhein-Neckar)
-  Channels for camps: *#t3c<location>*, e.g. **#t3ch** (Hamburg) or
   **#t3ch-hamburg** (is longer, but avoids ambiguity)

Some examples:

-  #t3o-development
-  #t3o-team
