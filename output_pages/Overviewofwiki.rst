Overview of Wiki
================

Categories
----------

This is an overview of what is currently in the Wiki. The categories
[outdated wiki link] are being used to categorize and tag the Wiki.
There are some ways to categorize the content e.g. by DocumentState, by
ContentType etc.

ContentType
^^^^^^^^^^^

category:

-  TYPO3 **documentation** (english). You can find documentation in the
   subcategories of the category Documentation:
   https://wiki.typo3.org/Category:Documentation [outdated wiki link]
-  TYPO3 **documentation (other languages)**, e.g. (Japanese):
   https://wiki.typo3.org/Ja:T3Doc/doc_core_inside/Using_versioning_and_workspaces
   [outdated wiki link]
-  **Extension documentation**: For some older extensions, a Wiki page
   is still used as documentation (see category
   https://wiki.typo3.org/Category:ExtensionDocumentation [outdated wiki
   link]). In the meantime, it is recommended to add the documentation
   to the Git repository of the extension and render it on GitHub,
   Gitlab and / or docs.typo3.org. For some of these (but not for all),
   the category Category:ExtensionsOnlyDocumentation [outdated wiki
   link] was used. This category is for "pages in this wiki that are the
   only available documentation of the extension." The pages that have
   the documentation elsewhere can be marked as to be deleted with
   {{delete}}.
-  **Exception** descriptions + hints: uses the prefix "Exception", see
   https://wiki.typo3.org/Special:PrefixIndex?prefix=Exception&namespace=0
   [outdated wiki link] for an overview

   also team page: https://wiki.typo3.org/Teams [outdated wiki link].
