Orientation
===========

This page is a presentation of work and goals of the Documentation Team
("DocTeam").

What we do
==========

We take care for the official TYPO3 documentation and the things related
to it. This includes the official manuals, which are specially
referenced in the `"Documentation"
section <https://typo3.org/documentation>`__ on typo3.org, and
information on this wiki. We also have an eye on the structure of pages
here in the wiki.

To get a more detailed overview of what we do, have a look at our
current projects:
