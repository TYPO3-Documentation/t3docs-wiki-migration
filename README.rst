TYPO3 Wiki Migration
====================

Currently the official TYPO3 documentation is spread across different places. To collect all documentation in one place,
docs.typo3.org, this repository contains the tools and scripts to support the migration of wiki.typo3.org to
docs.typo3.org.

`Conversion <convert>`_
   The original MediaWiki pages of wiki.typo3.org get fetched and converted from HTML to reST in this sub folder.
