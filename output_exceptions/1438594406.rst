========================
Exception/CMS/1438594406
========================

On possible cause for this is the use of old ext_tables/TCA
configuration. Please see
https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-core/master/en-us/Changelog/7.6/Index.html
for the changes in TYPO3. Also, the TCA file must return the array, not
only declare it, as would work before.
