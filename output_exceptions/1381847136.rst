#1381847136: Could not determine the current charset of the database.

Did you update MySQL last time and this exception occurred? First verify
if MySQL can check the charsets by running SQL in some GUI:

::

   SHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE 'character_set%';

If it show's you the error like **Table
'performance_schema.session_variables' doesn't exist** you can try to
fix it by the console command:

::

   mysql_upgrade -u root -p --force

(restart MySQL after all)
