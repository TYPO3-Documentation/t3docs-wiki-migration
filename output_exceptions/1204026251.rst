You probably ran into a race condition which is described in
https://forge.typo3.org/issues/46205 and has been fixed in 6.0.5 Try to
update to TYPO3 6.0.6 (or the latest patch level release 6.0.x) and then
to clear your /typo3temp/Cache/ folder.

It could also be that you are over quota and this might also occur when
the disk is full.
