========================

I encountered this issue while working with Value Objects in a rather
complex Object while trying to persist it. After **changing the model
type from Value Object to Entity in the model.php** it worked. I can't
tell what the implications of this change would be for your models but
looking at the discussion on this blogpost [outdated link] maybe for you
there is none.
