Template is not writeable

Happens when your filepermissions (Unix) are not correct if you include
TypoScript from a file and try to edit it in the backend.

Solution: Change filepermissions to make the file writeable by the
webserver, ie.

chgrp www-data fileadmin/templates/typoscript.txt && chmod g+w www-data
