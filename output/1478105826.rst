========================

I Got this Error after migrating an extension from TYPO3 CMS 7 to 8 and
had copied some code from 'ext_tables.php' to
'Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tt_content.php' I did not notice, that
$_EXTKEY is not set so an included template could not be resolved and
$file was empty.

After that i cound not edit any record in backend.

// Flexform

::

      // ========================================================================
      $GLOBALS['TCA']['tt_content']['types']['list']['subtypes_addlist']['slider'] = 'pi_flexform';
      \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::addPiFlexFormValue(
          $contentElement,
          'FILE:EXT:' . $_EXTKEY . '/Configuration/FlexForms/slider.xml' 
      );

Setting $_EXTKEY to name of my extension solved it.
