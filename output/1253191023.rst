========================

**#1253191023: TypoScript object path "tt_content.list.20.yourext" does
not exist**

| Using fluid_styled_content (only, in my case), had to obviously add a
  list entry for my current plugin.
| fluid_styled_content needs you to override its default *if you change
  the templateRootPaths*
| Meaning that when overriding lib.fluidContent, you need to add
  something like this:

::

   lib.fluidContent {
       templateName = YourTemplateName
       templateRootPaths {
           30 = EXT:myext/Resources/Private/Templates
       }
       layoutRootPaths {
           30 = EXT:myext/Resources/Private/Layouts
       }
       partialRootPaths {
           30 = EXT:myext/Resources/Private/Partials
       }
       list {
           templateName = YourListTemplateName
       }
   }
