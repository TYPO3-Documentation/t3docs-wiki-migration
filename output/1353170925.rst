The relation information for property "propertyXX" of class "TX\ext_key\Domain\Model\SomeModelYY" is missing.
=============================================================================================================

If you have a propery in a class SomeModelYY which has another class as
type

::

          /**
           * @var TX\ext_key\Domain\Model\SomeOtherModelZZ
           */
          protected $propertyXX;
           

the object will be populated by extbase without any other configuration.

But to make queries like

::

     $query->like("propertyXX.someproperty", '%foo%') 

work, you still have to declare a 'foreign_table' in your TCA.

Also be sure, to have the properties with getter and setter in your
model.
