========================

This error can happen, when a record, containing a fal relation, is
about to be translated into another language. Reason: 1. The fal data
was created before any languages were created. In that case just delete
the original fal data and recreate it. 2. The TCA is missing an
"appearance" configuration, e.g.:

[...] => ['config' => [

::

      'appearance' => [
          'showPossibleLocalizationRecords' => true,
          'showRemovedLocalizationRecords' => true,
          'showAllLocalizationLink' => true,
          'showSynchronizationLink' => true,
          'enabledControls' => [
              'info' => false,
          ]
      ]

]]
